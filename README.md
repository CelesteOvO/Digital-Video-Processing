# Digital-Video-Processing

Digital video technology and application

Only the things in DigitalVideoProcessing.cpp and VideoPlayer.cpp are useful

(Everything else is just a draft. There are main functions in each file, so you need to comment all the files you don't need or move them out of the project, which is a future improvement.)
